	description "The Vell-os Dart is the first form of living ship that a Vell-os pilot bonds with. Though small and seemingly fragile, it possesses remarkable regenerative abilities and grows stronger through the mental link with its pilot. The ship's organic nature makes it unlike any human-built vessel."
